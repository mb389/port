Hey all!

My name is Mike and I'm a 30-year-old ex-Wall Street risk manager living in Brooklyn, NY. I'm a CFA charterholder and active stock & option investor with a passion for all things markets & investing. 

I've been spending a considerable amount of time recently focusing on the peer to peer lending space, an area I believe stands to see considerable growth in the near future. Through my research and personal experience, I've developed a general strategic framework to tackling investing in peer to peer loans, which has yielded great returns for me. I'll use this blog to share the approach that has helped me achieve outsized returns personally,  along with sharing notable developments or interesting thoughts I come across on the space in general. 

### Topics to be covered will include:

* Assessing return objectives & risk
* Allocation of peer to peer lending in your overall portfolio
* Primary market strategies
* Filter-based investing
* Automated credit model-based investing
* Secondary market strategies
* Discounted current notes
* Distressed notes
* Strategic selling
* Portfolio maintenance
* Tax considerations
* And more...


Stay tuned!
