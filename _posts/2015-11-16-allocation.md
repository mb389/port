## How Much Do I Invest?

As we strive to maintain a diversified portfolio of assets, the inevitable questions arises -- how much of my portfolio should be allocated to peer to peer loans. There are a few different ways to approach this question, but I believe the LendingRobot team's method, detailed in [this report](https://d2qh2u5m1l6y4n.cloudfront.net/media/other/howmuchtoinvest.pdf), is both easy to understand and sufficiently back by quantitative evidence.

While I recommend reading the LR report in it's entirety, I'll summarize below.

If you assume your current asset breakdown looks something like Barry Ritholtz's "All-Century Portfolio", it is comprised of 8 different investment types incl. US & Global Stocks, US REITs (or actual real estate), US Corporate Bonds, and US Treasury TIPS, w/ each type representing 5-20% of the portfolio. This initial portfolio has an average return of *7%* and volatility of *40.3%* over 10 years.

They go on to use the concepts of MPT (Modern Portfolio Theory), to evaluate the changes to average return and volatility when adding various amounts of P2P loans to the portfolio. While P2P loans have a lower average return over the observation period (5.2%), they also have a dramatically lower volatility (2.7%). More importantly, they are generally uncorrelated to all of the other assets in the portfolio, showing cross-correlations between -0.13 and +0.19.

The final finding shows that the optimal return-to-risk ratios are achieved when between *12 and 14%* of the portfolio is comprised of P2P loans.
